### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lovisa Carling and I'm a Front end developer consultant at Axakon. I decided to change my career as a Project Lead to a Developer after getting hooked up on JavaScript when I encountered it in a chatbot implementation I was leading. Since then I've graduated from Techngio Front end developer bootcamp in February 2022 after creating 21 weekly projects including frontend, backend and fullstack. As a consultant I work with a Swedish government mastering new skills daily as well as digging deeper into already explored ones.

âœ¨ My tech stack includes âœ¨
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript ES6
- React
- Redux toolkit
- Redux Saga
- TypeScript
- Node.js (Express/Mongoose)
- MongoDB
- React Native
- Styled Components
- Material UI

I live in Solna, Stockholm together with my boyfriend and my two cats, Clint and Whoopi (yes they are named after the actress/actor). When not working as a consultant or developing personal projects I prefer to game with friends, working out or watching new series.

âš¡ Currently âš¡
- Playing: League of Legends (never stopped to be honest ðŸ˜„)
- Watching: Vikings, Moon Knight and Parks & Recreation.
- Listening to: A lot of different genres and artist but Imagine Dragons is always on repeat!
- Working out with: Jump rope, spinning, running or weights.
