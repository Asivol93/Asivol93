### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lovisa Carling and I'm a Front end developer consultant at Axakon. I decided to change my career as a Project Lead to a Developer after getting hooked up on JavaScript when I encountered in an ongoing project with a technical solution based on it. Since then I've graduated from Techngio Front end developer bootcamp in February 2022 after creating 21 weekly projects including frontend, backend and fullstack. As a consultant I work with a Swedish government mastering new skills daily as well as digging deeper into already explored ones.

âœ¨ My tech stack includes âœ¨
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript ES6
- React
- Redux toolkit
- Redux Saga
- TypeScript
- Node.js (Express/Mongoose)
- MongoDB
- React Native
- Styled Components
- Material UI
